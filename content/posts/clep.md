Be sure to check with your school to see which CLEP exams are accepted. (In my experience, CLEP exams only apply to 100-200 level lower-division courses - and you need to talk to the admissions department of your target school to find out which CLEP exams map to which classes.)
* **Register for a CLEP exam.** You can register for a CLEP exam online or by contacting your local testing center.
